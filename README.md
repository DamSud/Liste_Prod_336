## Important Notice about file extension

As Microsoft Excel is currently the only way to edit and execute Office Script, git and VSCode has no way to colore-style (or recognize) the syntax in a `.osts` (Office Script extension) file.
Thus I am saving the files in the repo as basic `.ts` (Type Script) files.
